# Traditional Machine Learning Algorithms

## Overview

This subfolder contains implementations of a variety of traditional machine learning algorithms. Each algorithm is implemented with thorough documentation and examples to aid users in understanding the concepts and applications of each method. These algorithms are fundamental to the field of machine learning and provide robust solutions to many types of data analysis problems.

## Algorithms Included

- **Linear Regression**: A simple yet powerful algorithm for modeling the relationship between a scalar dependent variable and one or more explanatory variables. (implementation pending)
- **Logistic Regression**: Used for binary classification tasks, predicting the probability of an outcome. (implementation pending)
- **Decision Trees**: A non-linear model built on tree-like structures to model decisions and their possible consequences. (implementation pending)
- **Random Forests**: An ensemble learning method for classification and regression which builds multiple decision trees and merges them to get a more accurate and stable prediction. (implementation pending)
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Effective in high dimensional spaces and best suited for problems with clear margin of separation. (implementation pending)
- **Naive Bayes**: Based on Bayes’ Theorem, it’s particularly suited for large volumes of data and is effective in text classification problems. (implementation pending)
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A simple, lazy learning algorithm used for classification and regression. (implementation pending)
- **K-Means Clustering**: An unsupervised learning algorithm for identifying groups (clusters) within data. (implementation pending)
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: A statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables. (implementation pending)
- **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)**: A boosting technique which builds models from weak learners sequentially to create a strong predictive model. (implementation pending)
- **AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting)**: A boosting algorithm that can be used in conjunction with many other types of learning algorithms to improve performance. (implementation pending)

Each folder within this subfolder corresponds to a specific algorithm and contains the following:
- Python implementation file(s)
- A brief tutorial on how to use the algorithm
- Sample input and output
- Additional resources for further reading

## Usage

To use any of the algorithms, navigate to the respective algorithm's folder and follow the instructions in the README.md file located within that folder. Example usage is provided to demonstrate how to prepare data, run the algorithm, and interpret results.
